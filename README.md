# CRUDS (Operations On Data) 🧑‍💻
## A CRUDS (Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search) product management system is a fundamental tool for efficiently managing product data within a business. Here's a simple breakdown of each component:

• Create ➕: This functionality allows users to add new products to the system. It typically involves providing information such as product name, description, price, quantity, and any other relevant details.

• Read 📖: Users can view existing product information stored in the system. This includes accessing details such as product name, description, price, quantity, and any other associated data.

• Update 🔄️: Users can modify the existing product information as needed. This may involve changing details like product name, description, price, or quantity to reflect any updates or changes in the product's status.

• Delete ❌: This functionality enables users to remove products from the system when they are no longer relevant or available for sale. It helps in maintaining an accurate and up-to-date product database.

• Search 🔎: Users can search for specific products within the system based on various criteria such as product name, category, price range, or any other relevant attributes. This feature enhances usability by allowing users to quickly find the information they need.

In a CRUDS product management system, these functionalities form the core operations for managing product data efficiently. The system provides a user-friendly interface for performing these operations, facilitating seamless product management and ensuring data accuracy and integrity.
